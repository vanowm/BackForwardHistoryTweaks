Legend:

+ = Added
! = Fixed
* = Changed
- = Removed

v1.6.2 (2017-12-21)
This extension cannot be ported to WebExtension. Currently WebExtension API doesn't provide ability manipulate browser's GUI. So, please don't ask update it to work with Firefox Quantum, it might still work if you enable extensions.legacy.enabled
	+ ability copy list of current addon's preferences in clipboard when clicked on support email
	+ option to show separate history list based on which button was clicked on (back separate from forward) (issue #12)
	+ option to sort "All tabs" list, controls by extensions.backforwardhistorytweaks.alltabssort accepts number 1-7 (bitwise: 1 = by name, 2 = by domain, 3 = group by domain)
	+ "All tabs" list have scrollbars or up/down buttons just like back/forward list
("All tabs" is totally unrelated to this addon, I know, but I personally needed it and since Mozilla doesn't accept new "legacy" addons anymore, I had no choice but to incorporate it into existing one)

v1.5 (2016-03-14)
	+ hidden setting extensions.backforwardhistorytweaks.curFavIcon which controls issue #7 (Add fav icon for current site)
	+ when clicked on addon's email support link ask if user would like include additional information about enabled extensions, plugins, themes into the email

	! another attempt to fix popup menu shown when new window opened or setting changed. For now support for individual back and forward popups are dropped. If this breaks other addons, please let me know.
